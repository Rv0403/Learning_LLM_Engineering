       "- When books stand on a shelf, the order is: cover of vol.1, pages of vol.1, cover of vol.1, then cover of vol.2, pages of vol.2, cover of vol.2. Typically, adjacent volumes share a side cover, but here they are simply two volumes placed side by side with their covers touching.\n",
       "\n",
       "Important detail: the worm starts at the first page of the first volume and ends at the last page of the second volume, i.e., it goes from the very first page of vol.1 to the very last page of vol.2. The worm travels perpendicular to the pages—i.e., in a straight line through the thicknesses of the books and the covers along the shelf.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the standard arrangement, the worm would traverse:\n",
       "- From the first page of vol.1 inward toward the inside of vol.1: it must pass through the first page itself and the rest of vol.1’s pages, and through the inside cover of vol.1 to reach the gap between vol.1 and vol.2 (the neighboring outside-of-vol.1 side). However, because the worm starts at the first page, the distance through vol.1’s pages is effectively the entire thickness of vol.1’s pages plus the inner cover thickness (the part between the first page and the inner surface of vol.1’s front cover) is included in the page thickness and the cover thickness.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the standard neat trick for this puzzle is to realize that:\n",
       "- The total thickness needed to reach from the first page of vol.1 to the last page of vol.2 equals the sum of: all pages of vol.1, all pages of vol.2, plus the thicknesses of the two outer covers that lie between the starting point and ending point, while excluding the two inner faces that touch each other between the volumes (the adjacent touching surfaces between the two volumes do not contribute because the worm does not pass through the touching confronting surfaces beyond the outermost pages).\n",
       "\n",
       "A more straightforward classic result: the distance gnawed equals the sum of the two cover thicknesses plus the thicknesses of all pages except the outermost facing sides, but in this setup, the common puzzle answer is simply the distance through all pages and both outer covers, i.e.\n",

       "- Pages: 2 cm each volume, so 2 + 2 = 4 cm total pages.\n",
       "- Outer covers: each 0.2 cm, two outer covers contribute 0.4 cm.\n",
